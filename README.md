# Yu-Gi-Oh-Ex

Rudimentary Yu-Gi-Oh LOTD LE mod tools
Much like my https://github.com/Arefu/Wolf project, but this one will only work with Link Evolutions.

I haven't worked on it in awhile thanks to no motivation, I've got a lot of stuff documented internally in the CT table thanks to other resources, and made an Dear ImGui window hook for it, I do want to try make an unoffical mp client/server so we don't need to be on Steam, but eh.

Hit me up if you want to help, or just ... do?
