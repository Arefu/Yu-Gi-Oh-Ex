# Yu-Gi-Oh-Ex

Rudimentary Yu-Gi-Oh LOTD LE mod tools
Much like my https://github.com/Arefu/Wolf project, but this one will only work with Link Evolutions.

I haven't worked on it in awhile thanks to no motivation, I've got a lot of stuff documented internally in the CT table thanks to other resources, and made an Dear ImGui window hook for it, I do want to try make an unoffical mp client/server so we don't need to be on Steam, but I never seem to get gud.

Hit me up if you want to help, or just ... do?

I'd suggest checking out the wiki, I've got some information there, the cheat Table documents a fair amount of the 'duel table' as you're dueling the wiki is more dealing wioth re'ing the exe and working out how deep mod support could go if given the brain power, pretty stubborn and always seem to return to this, so who klnows.
