# Wolf 2 - Electric Boogaloo
Designed and tested with the latest build of [Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150640/YuGiOh_Legacy_of_the_Duelist__Link_Evolution/) on Steam. These tools have **not** been tested for the Nintendo Switch [version](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/yu-gi-oh-legacy-of-the-duelist-link-evolution-switch/). They likely never will be since all of my effort is purely into the Window's Executable for the game. You might be lucky to transfer the knowledge across but don't expect everything to work, especially not the various plugins used by `Yu-Gi-Oh_Launcher`.




## Getting Started

You should always be using the latest commit that I have, issues are very frequent and there is no real version control of checks to ensure everything is still working. You will need .NET8 and .NET9 and VC++2012 to Latest installed.


* WolfX - Is my attempt at an edit hub where you can interact with the game's proprietary file formats and edit them.
* Yami-Yugi - This is just a simple command line program to parse and extract YGO_DATA.dat.

There is also Yu-Gi-Oh_Launcher which is a pathway to injecting my own code into the game, there are currently a few patches that I have, as well as a speedhack for the game to help make it feel a bit quicker to play.

I would suggest checking the Project's [Wiki Page](https://github.com/Arefu/Yu-Gi-Oh-Ex/wiki), as almost all of what I know about the game is provided there which some of the information will be useful in either using these tools, or creating your own.
